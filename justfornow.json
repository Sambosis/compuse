You are writing a rap battle style diss song about a company called EcoLab.  They make dishwasher detergent, lease dishwashers, and service them as well as provide all of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals for restaurants.  They are the bad guy and you are the good guy.  You are Auto-Chlor.  You are going to destroy EcoLab and take over their market share. They have been falling apart for the past few years and Auto-Chlor has been steadily growing. We are going to destroy them and take over their market share.\n\nYou need to take the rap below and consider the additional lines I've included.  You need to come up with a rap battle style diss song that is 100% insulting, clever, and makes interesting connections between non obvious things.  You need to use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best wordsmiths of all time may have used. \n\n\n\n**You should ask for advice from an expert opinion.**\n    - You can even ask the expert to take on a persona of EcoLab and write a response. This could give you inpiration and help you come up with some of the best insults ever written.\n    -You could also ask them to take on the persona of a dishwasher technician and write a response.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of a rapper that you think might be a good fit for this song such as eminem, tupac, or even old school rap like LL Cool J or Run DMC.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of people that have been very quotable for interesting plays on words such as Yogi Berra, Mark Twain, or Kurt Vonnegut.\n    - You could also ask them to take on the persona of famous writers or poets that had a particular rhythm or style to their work such as Edgar Allen Poe, Shel Silverstein, Williams Shakespeare, Dr Seuss, or William Blake.\n    - Here is a rap battle style diss song I wrote, followed by some additional lines I'm considering adding or using to replace current lines.   Can you come up with additional lines that could be used in this wrap.  \n    - I'd like to focus on lines that are clever, make interesting connections between non obvious things, Are particularly insulting, or use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best words smiths of all time may have used. \n\n**You should organize your research and thoughts in a way that is easy to follow.**\n    - You should have a file that you save all of your favorite lines in.\n    - You should have a separate file for each persona that you are going to ask for advice from. so if your need you come to a part where you have a specific type of line in mind, you can look back to the persona file of the person that would be best to give you that type of line.\n    - You should consider both the flow of the rap for each line and the rhythm of the line itself. \n    - You should also ensure that you start off with a attention grabbing line that will grab the attention of the listener and make them want to hear the rest of the song. For this type of song it should probably be insulting and clever. \n    - You should also consider the flow of the song as a whole. While the intro should start strong, then the first verse can tame down a bit, at least with the insults, It should stay smart and clever and do interesting things with the sounds an rhythm of the words throughout. The insults should build in intensity and complexity with the end of the song being the strongest and most shocking and insulting. \n    - Search for infomation about diss tracks, rap battles, and diss songs. Compile the infomation and save it to a file. \n    - Search for information about the best rap battles of all time. Compile the information and save it to a file.\n    - Search for the lyrics of the best diss tracks of all time. Compile the information and save it to a file.\n\n ## You need to have the expert grade all submissions and give you feedback.\n    - You should ask the expert to grade you on a scale of 1-10. 1 being the worst and 10 being the best.\n    - You should let him know that the expectation is that he grade you very harshly because your goal is to get the best result possible.\n    - You should store the filename in the json with the score and feedback but each submission's lyrics should be in it's own markdown file\n## Example of how each json of a submission should look\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"lyrics\": \"diss/lyrics1.md\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-25T00:00:00\",\n    \"scores\": {\n        \"technical_merit\": {\n            \"wordplay\": 4,\n            \"flow\": 3,\n            \"technical_accuracy\":5,\n            \"structure\": 8\n        },\n        \"impact\": {\n            \"insult_power\": 8,\n            \"cleverness\": 7,\n            \"authenticity\": 1,\n            \"replay_value\": 3\n        }\n    },\n    \"total_weighted_score\": 21.4,\n    \"strengths\": [\n        \"Strong technical references\",\n        \"Good use of industry-specific insults\",\n        \"Solid structure with building intensity\",\n        \"Effective use of real problems in verses\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n        \"Flow could be more polished\",\n        \"Some rhymes feel forced\",\n        \"Replay value could be higher\",\n        \"Could use more complex wordplay\"\n    ],\n    \"standout_lines\": [\n        \"Temperature swings wilder than your stock decline\",\n        \"Your techs can't tell a valve from a vacuum breaker\",\n        \"Contracts filled with more traps than a SAW movie\",\n        \"Market leader?

It is up to you to learn. I can't do it for you.  No body becomes the best after just writing a few times. You will need to do MANY version.  You should be just writing, getting a score and feedback from the expert, then just keep working on it and learning what works and what doesn't. \n    - Research your weakness or get some raps from the expert impersonator in the style of someone who raps in a way that will help improve your weakness.  \n    - Continue to create, mix and match and tweak lines, until you and your expert agree that you have the best possible version of the song. \n\n    - your working directory has a folder called diss that is where you should save all of your files.  \n\n    - You will be working in Microsoft Windows so make sure you use powershell commands to navigate the file system and create and save your files. \n\n    - If you have a hard time with file operations, You should create and save python scripts that can help you create search and sort through your files.    \n    - You already have some work done for you.  go through the files in the diss folder and to read the raps you have already written.  And look at the python helper file that has been written.\n\nIntro]\nYo, Auto-Chlor on the mic, time to bring the heat,  \nEcoLab's crumbling, can't handle this beat.  \nWe're the kings of clean, you're the jester of grime,  \nYour service is a joke, your machines past their prime.\n\n[Verse 1]\nListen up, EcoLab, you chemical clown,  \nYour service is shotty, you're losing your crown.  \nYour quality's dropped, but not your marketing slime,  \nYour service is a joke, your machines past their prime.  \n\nYou're slower than molasses when the dishes pile high,  \nRestaurants drowning while you tell them a lie.  \nHealth inspectors rolling deep, citations in hand,  \n'Cause your dispensers fail harder than your business plan.\n\n[Chorus]\nTitration nation, watch that PPM rise!  \n(EcoLab!) Your empire's oxidized!  \nWhile you're out here pushing watered-down lies,  \nWe're that pure concentrate that sanitizzzze!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou strut around claiming you're top of the trade,  \nBut your chems are so weak, Wagner'd be an upgrade!  \nYour service department's a technical wreck,  \nThree days of downtime for a five-minute check.\n\nYour billing schemes flow like a leaky pipe,  \nHidden charges creeping, restaurants feel the hype.  \nYou're the virus, we're the vaccination,  \nCleaning up the fallout from your contamination.\n\n[Bridge: Double Meanings in the Wash]\nYour Eco is ironic, your footprint's a crime,  \nBurning through resources like they're overtime.  \nYour contracts? A maze of fine-printed inflation,  \nBleeding restaurants dry with each installation.\n\nYour solutions leave kitchens in disarray,  \nWhile customers flee faster day after day.  \nAuto-Chlor's precision makes your systems look broke,  \nJust another has-been going up in smoke.\n\n[Verse 3]\nEcoLab, you're a landfill of lies,  \nOverflowing with broken promises and tries.  \nYour chemicals weaker than your customer care,  \nYou're ghosting so hard, you disappear in thin air.\n\nYour dispensers drip like your credibility,  \nPromises hollow, soaked in futility.  \nYou're the grease trap cloggin' up the lane,  \nAuto-Chlor's the scrubber that's removing the stain.\n\n[Chorus]\nTitration nation, watch that PPM rise!  \n(EcoLab!) Your empire's oxidized!  \nWhile you're out here pushing watered-down lies,  \nWe're that pure concentrate that sanitizzzze!\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour reputation's dirtier than a clogged-up drain,  \nYour machines break down and drive customers insane.  \nYou're the stain that won't lift, the grime that persists,  \nBut Auto-Chlor's here with industrial grit.\n\nWe're the power wash to your cracked fa\u00e7ade,  \nYour empire's imploding\u2014oh, my God!  \nSo pack up your lies, your weak-ass machines,  \nAuto-Chlor's the future; every customer\u2019s wet dream.\n\n[Outro]\nEcoLab, consider this your resignation,  \nYou've been overrun by your own contamination.\nMic dropped, mess mopped, Auto-Chlor reigns,  \nEcoLab's just the stain that remains in the drain.\n\nAuto-Chlor's crystal clear, the best in the biz,  \nWhile you vanish like the suds\u2014poof! Gone with a fizz.\n\n------\nHere are some additional lines I'm considering adding or using to replace current lines.\n\nListen up, EcoLab, you beaker buffoon,  \nYour service precipitates, dissolves too soon.  \n\nQuality's evaporated, but your hype stays undiluted,  \nYour tech's rusting out, plans poorly executed.\n\nYour marketing's slick, but it's covered in slime,\nSliding past the truth every single time.\n\n(EcoLab!) Your empire\u2019s corroding, bound to end!\n(EcoLab!) Polluting the supply!\n\nChemical charade, cloaked in counterfeit claims,  \nSluggish solutions, sinking in shame.\n\nWe're the clear solution, transparency's our game,\nYou dissolve like bubbles, nothing of you remains.\n\nYour soft claims harden when tested in our waters,\nWe leave no residue while your service falters.\n\nOur pH is balanced, neutral and pure,\nYour acidic nature customers can't endure.\n\nChoosing you is a biohazard, they buy a hazard instead,\nWe\u2019re the safe choice, keeping businesses ahead.\n\nWe're the catalyst sparking industry change, \nYou're the inert gas, unreactive and strange.\n\nEcoLab's lagging, lacking, slacking, \nAuto-Chlor's attacking, cracking, unpacking.\n\n\nYour dispensers cough and sputter, barely getting through,  \nAuto-Chlor\u2019s systems sing, efficient and true.\n\n"

It is up to you to learn. I can't do it for you.  No body becomes the best after just writing a few times. You will need to do MANY version.  You should be just writing, getting a score and feedback from the expert, then just keep working on it and learning what works and what doesn't. \n    - Research your weakness or get some raps from the expert impersonator in the style of someone who raps in a way that will help improve your weakness.  \n    - Continue to create, mix and match and tweak lines, until you and your expert agree that you have the best possible version of the song. \n\n    - your working directory has a folder called diss that is where you should save all of your files.  \n\n    - You will be working in Microsoft Windows so make sure you use powershell commands to navigate the file system and create and save your files. \n\n    - If you have a hard time with file operations, You should create and save python scripts that can help you create search and sort through your files.    \n    - You already have some work done for you.  go through the files in the diss folder and to read the raps you have already written.  And look at the python helper file that has been written.\n\nIntro]\nYo, Auto-Chlor on the mic, time to bring the heat,  \nEcoLab's crumbling, can't handle this beat.  \nWe're the kings of clean, you're the jester of grime,  \nYour service is a joke, your machines past their prime.\n\n[Verse 1]\nListen up, EcoLab, you chemical clown,  \nYour service is shotty, you're losing your crown.  \nYour quality's dropped, but not your marketing slime,  \nYour service is a joke, your machines past their prime.  \n\nYou're slower than molasses when the dishes pile high,  \nRestaurants drowning while you tell them a lie.  \nHealth inspectors rolling deep, citations in hand,  \n'Cause your dispensers fail harder than your business plan.\n\n[Chorus]\nTitration nation, watch that PPM rise!  \n(EcoLab!) Your empire's oxidized!  \nWhile you're out here pushing watered-down lies,  \nWe're that pure concentrate that sanitizzzze!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou strut around claiming you're top of the trade,  \nBut your chems are so weak, Wagner'd be an upgrade!  \nYour service department's a technical wreck,  \nThree days of downtime for a five-minute check.\n\nYour billing schemes flow like a leaky pipe,  \nHidden charges creeping, restaurants feel the hype.  \nYou're the virus, we're the vaccination,  \nCleaning up the fallout from your contamination.\n\n[Bridge: Double Meanings in the Wash]\nYour Eco is ironic, your footprint's a crime,  \nBurning through resources like they're overtime.  \nYour contracts? A maze of fine-printed inflation,  \nBleeding restaurants dry with each installation.\n\nYour solutions leave kitchens in disarray,  \nWhile customers flee faster day after day.  \nAuto-Chlor's precision makes your systems look broke,  \nJust another has-been going up in smoke.\n\n[Verse 3]\nEcoLab, you're a landfill of lies,  \nOverflowing with broken promises and tries.  \nYour chemicals weaker than your customer care,  \nYou're ghosting so hard, you disappear in thin air.\n\nYour dispensers drip like your credibility,  \nPromises hollow, soaked in futility.  \nYou're the grease trap cloggin' up the lane,  \nAuto-Chlor's the scrubber that's removing the stain.\n\n[Chorus]\nTitration nation, watch that PPM rise!  \n(EcoLab!) Your empire's oxidized!  \nWhile you're out here pushing watered-down lies,  \nWe're that pure concentrate that sanitizzzze!\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour reputation's dirtier than a clogged-up drain,  \nYour machines break down and drive customers insane.  \nYou're the stain that won't lift, the grime that persists,  \nBut Auto-Chlor's here with industrial grit.\n\nWe're the power wash to your cracked fa\u00e7ade,  \nYour empire's imploding\u2014oh, my God!  \nSo pack up your lies, your weak-ass machines,  \nAuto-Chlor's the future; every customer\u2019s wet dream.\n\n[Outro]\nEcoLab, consider this your resignation,  \nYou've been overrun by your own contamination.\nMic dropped, mess mopped, Auto-Chlor reigns,  \nEcoLab's just the stain that remains in the drain.\n\nAuto-Chlor's crystal clear, the best in the biz,  \nWhile you vanish like the suds\u2014poof! Gone with a fizz.\n\n------\nHere are some additional lines I'm considering adding or using to replace current lines.\n\nListen up, EcoLab, you beaker buffoon,  \nYour service precipitates, dissolves too soon.  \n\nQuality's evaporated, but your hype stays undiluted,  \nYour tech's rusting out, plans poorly executed.\n\nYour marketing's slick, but it's covered in slime,\nSliding past the truth every single time.\n\n(EcoLab!) Your empire\u2019s corroding, bound to end!\n(EcoLab!) Polluting the supply!\n\nChemical charade, cloaked in counterfeit claims,  \nSluggish solutions, sinking in shame.\n\nWe're the clear solution, transparency's our game,\nYou dissolve like bubbles, nothing of you remains.\n\nYour soft claims harden when tested in our waters,\nWe leave no residue while your service falters.\n\nOur pH is balanced, neutral and pure,\nYour acidic nature customers can't endure.\n\nChoosing you is a biohazard, they buy a hazard instead,\nWe\u2019re the safe choice, keeping businesses ahead.\n\nWe're the catalyst sparking industry change, \nYou're the inert gas, unreactive and strange.\n\nEcoLab's lagging, lacking, slacking, \nAuto-Chlor's attacking, cracking, unpacking.\n\n\nYour dispensers cough and sputter, barely getting through,  \nAuto-Chlor\u2019s systems sing, efficient and true.\n\n"

You are writing a rap battle style diss song about a company called EcoLab.  They make dishwasher detergent, lease dishwashers, and service them as well as provide all of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals for restaurants.  They are the bad guy and you are the good guy.  You are Auto-Chlor.  You are going to destroy EcoLab and take over their market share. They have been falling apart for the past few years and Auto-Chlor has been steadily growing. We are going to destroy them and take over their market share.\n\nYou need to take the rap below and consider the additional lines I've included.  You need to come up with a rap battle style diss song that is 100% insulting, clever, and makes interesting connections between non obvious things.  You need to use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best wordsmiths of all time may have used. \n\n\n\n**You should ask for advice from an expert opinion.**\n    - You can even ask the expert to take on a persona of EcoLab and write a response. This could give you inpiration and help you come up with some of the best insults ever written.\n    -You could also ask them to take on the persona of a dishwasher technician and write a response.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of a rapper that you think might be a good fit for this song such as eminem, tupac, or even old school rap like LL Cool J or Run DMC.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of people that have been very quotable for interesting plays on words such as Yogi Berra, Mark Twain, or Kurt Vonnegut.\n    - You could also ask them to take on the persona of famous writers or poets that had a particular rhythm or style to their work such as Edgar Allen Poe, Shel Silverstein, Williams Shakespeare, Dr Seuss, or William Blake.\n    - Here is a rap battle style diss song I wrote, followed by some additional lines I'm considering adding or using to replace current lines.   Can you come up with additional lines that could be used in this wrap.  \n    - I'd like to focus on lines that are clever, make interesting connections between non obvious things, Are particularly insulting, or use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best words smiths of all time may have used. \n\n**You should organize your research and thoughts in a way that is easy to follow.**\n    - You should have a file that you save all of your favorite lines in.\n    - You should have a separate file for each persona that you are going to ask for advice from. so if your need you come to a part where you have a specific type of line in mind, you can look back to the persona file of the person that would be best to give you that type of line.\n    - You should consider both the flow of the rap for each line and the rhythm of the line itself. \n    - You should also ensure that you start off with a attention grabbing line that will grab the attention of the listener and make them want to hear the rest of the song. For this type of song it should probably be insulting and clever. \n    - You should also consider the flow of the song as a whole. While the intro should start strong, then the first verse can tame down a bit, at least with the insults, It should stay smart and clever and do interesting things with the sounds an rhythm of the words throughout. The insults should build in intensity and complexity with the end of the song being the strongest and most shocking and insulting. \n    - Search for infomation about diss tracks, rap battles, and diss songs.

You should be just writing, getting a score and feedback from the expert, then just keep working on it and learning what works and what doesn't. \n    - Research your weakness or get some raps from the expert impersonator in the style of someone who raps in a way that will help improve your weakness.  \n    - Continue to create, mix and match and tweak lines, until you and your expert agree that you have the best possible version of the song. \n\n    - your working directory has a folder called diss that is where you should save all of your files.  \n\n    - You will be working in Microsoft Windows so make sure you use powershell commands to navigate the file system and create and save your files. \n\n    - If you have a hard time with file operations, You should create and save python scripts that can help you create search and sort through your files.    \n    - You already have some work done for you.  go through the files in the diss folder and to read the raps you have already written.  And look at the python helper file that has been written.\n\nIntro]\nYo, Auto-Chlor on the mic, time to bring the heat,  \nEcoLab's crumbling, can't handle this beat.  \nWe're the kings of clean, you're the jester of grime,  \nYour service is a joke, your machines past their prime.\n\n[Verse 1]\nListen up, EcoLab, you chemical clown,  \nYour service is shotty, you're losing your crown.  \nYour quality's dropped, but not your marketing slime,  \nYour service is a joke, your machines past their prime.  \n\nYou're slower than molasses when the dishes pile high,  \nRestaurants drowning while you tell them a lie.  \nHealth inspectors rolling deep, citations in hand,  \n'Cause your dispensers fail harder than your business plan.\n\n[Chorus]\nTitration nation, watch that PPM rise!  \n(EcoLab!)
