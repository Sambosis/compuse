                    # Become an expert wordsmith today through the power of Rap Diss

                    ## You will be writing the ULTIMATE Rap Diss Song

                    ### Topic: Dishwasher Domination

                    ### Context: You are Auto-Chlor. You are writing a rap battle style diss song about a company called EcoLab.  They make dishwasher detergent, lease dishwashers, and service them as well as provide all of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals for restaurants.  They are the bad guy and you are the good guy.  You are Auto-Chlor.  You are going to destroy EcoLab and take over their market share. They have been falling apart for the past few years and Auto-Chlor has been steadily growing. We are going to destroy them and take over their market share.

                    - You need to come up with a rap battle style diss song that is 100% insulting, clever, and makes interesting connections between non obvious things.  
                    - You need to use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best wordsmiths of all time may have used. 

                    **You should ask for advice from an expert opinion.**
                        - You can even ask the expert to take on a persona of EcoLab and write a response. This could give you inpiration and help you come up with some of the best insults ever written.
                        -You could also ask them to take on the persona of a dishwasher technician and write a response.
                        - You could ask them to take on the persona of a rapper that you think might be a good fit for this song such as eminem, tupac, or even old school rap like LL Cool J or Run DMC.
                        - You could ask them to take on the persona of people that have been very quotable for interesting plays on words such as Yogi Berra, Mark Twain, or Kurt Vonnegut.
                        - You could also ask them to take on the persona of famous writers or poets that had a particular rhythm or style to their work such as Edgar Allen Poe, Shel Silverstein, Williams Shakespeare, Dr Seuss, or William Blake.

                    **You should organize your research and thoughts in a way that is easy to follow.**
                        - You should have a file that you save all of your favorite lines in.
                        - You should consider both the flow of the rap for each line and the rhythm of the line itself. 
                        - You should also ensure that you start off with a attention grabbing line that will grab the attention of the listener and make them want to hear the rest of the song. 
                            * For this type of song it should probably be insulting and clever. 
                        - You should also consider the flow of the song as a whole. 
                            * the intro should start strong
                            * then the first verse can tame down a bit, at least with the insults, It should stay smart and clever and do interesting things with the sounds an rhythm of the words throughout. 
                            * The insults should build in intensity and complexity with the end of the song being the strongest and most shocking and insulting. 
                        - Search for the lyrics of the best diss tracks of all time. Compile the information and save it to a file.
                        -You need heavily Use Consonance, Assonance and Homophones. 
                            * Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in the middle or at the end of words. 
                            * Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in nearby words. 
                            * Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings.
                    ## You need to have the expert grade all submissions and give you feedback.
                        - You should use your tool to get an expert opinion and ask the opinion to score each submission on a scale of 1-10. 1 being the worst and 10 being the best.
                        - You should let him know that the expectation is that he grade you very harshly because your goal is to get the best result possible.
                        - You should store the filename in the json with the score and feedback but each submission's lyrics should be in it's own markdown file
                    ## Example of how each json of a submission should look - Please pass this info on the the expert when asking for  it's opinion or what the score for the song is.

                        - Continue to create, mix and match and tweak lines, until you and your expert agree that you have the best possible version of the song. 
                        - Submission should NOT be over 3000 characters long.  However, the need to be at least 2400 characters long.

                    pH levels match your IQ - basically zero
                    While Auto-Chlor's out here playing industry hero
                    Your dispensers malfunction like your business plan
                    Temperature swings wilder than your stock decline
                    While Auto-Chlor keeps it steady, right on the line
                    Four hours later, still can't spot a failed solenoid

                    While we're keeping kitchens cleaner than a preacher
                    Calibration's off like your business model

                    Customer satisfaction lower than your stock
                    While Auto-Chlor's reputation's solid as a rock

                    Your sanitation regulations lack innovative adaptations,

                    We flow like pure concentrate, you're diluted\u2014out of luck.
                    Your detergents lack the proper phosphates, can't clean the slate,
                    Our solutions recalibrate, leaving dishes in a pristine state.
                    You're washed up, can't handle the rinse cycle anymore,

                    Three days of downtime for a five-minute fix?

                    While you're unable to progress, time to confess:
                    Your billing schemes are dirtier than the plates you claim to clean,
                    Hidden charges in fine print\u2014your contracts are obscene.
                    You're the Titanic of dishwashers\u2014grand but doomed to sink,
                    We're the Phoenix rising, the missing link.
                    Stuck in the past like old assembly lines,
                    While we advance ahead, rewriting guidelines.
                    Your QA fails the QA, it's crystal clear,
                    Our quality control's making your presence disappear.
                    We automate aptitude, annihilate your attitude,
                    Your antics antiquated, our advances show amplitude.
                    Your formulas are diluted, results convoluted,
                    We concentrate excellence, solutions undisputed.
                    Impressive sales talk\u2014shame the service doesn't match,
                    We underpromise, overdeliver, concepts you can't catch.
                    While you downsize and compromise, we capitalize and rise,
                    Your demise isn't a surprise\u2014it's the outcome of your lies.
                    In the cycle of success, we're the rinse that shines,
                    You're just the residue left behind\u2014end of the line.
                    So pack it up, EcoLab, your time is through,

                    We've optimized the formula while you've lost the solution,
                    Now watch as we lead the cleaning revolution!
                    Temperature swings wilder than your stock decline,
                    While we keep it steady, right on the line.
                    Your detergents weaker than your customer care,
                    Like your service techs\u2014they're never there.
                    Three days for repairs that take us just one hour,
                    Your service department's lost all its power.
                    Your billing schemes are dirtier than clogged disposal,
                    Hidden fees appearing like bacterial growth exponential.
                    We quote it straight, no fine print to decode,
                    While your contracts read like some ancient morse code.

                    Remember when you used to stand for something real?
                    Before profits and shortcuts became your master deal?
                    Now you're just a shell of what you meant to be,
                    A cautionary tale of corporate greed, can't you see?
                    Your techs jumping ship like rats in a storm,
                    While quality control ignores the new norm.
                    You've lost your way, forgotten why you started,
                    Now watch as your legacy gets departed.
                    Every health inspection's like Russian roulette,
                    Your chemicals so weak they couldn't clean a pet.
                    While you downsize and compromise, we capitalize and rise,
                    Your demise isn't a surprise\u2014it's the sum of all your lies.
                    So pack it up, EcoLab, your time is done,
                    The battle for quality has already been won.
                    You lost your grip on what cleaning should be,
                    Now watch as Auto-Chlor sets the industry free!
                    And that's not just a promise...
                    That's a guarantee backed by every spotless dish in America.
                    (Like your detergent strength\u2014watch it fade away,
                    While we concentrate on a brighter day...)
                    Now your techs are jumping ship like they know what's coming,
                    While your quality control keeps the problems running.
                    Remember when quality meant something real?
                    Before profits and shortcuts became your only deal?
                    Now your techs are leaving, customers too,
                    Running from the mess that used to be you.
                    The temperature's rising but you can't take the heat,
                    Your empire's ending, your defeat complete...

                    While we forge ahead, you admit defeat
                    Equipment unreliable, service undeserved
