You are writing a rap battle style diss song about a company called EcoLab.  They make dishwasher detergent, lease dishwashers, and service them as well as provide all of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals for restaurants.  They are the bad guy and you are the good guy.  You are Auto-Chlor.  You are going to destroy EcoLab and take over their market share. They have been falling apart for the past few years and Auto-Chlor has been steadily growing. We are going to destroy them and take over their market share.\n\n- You need to come up with a rap battle style diss song that is 100% insulting, clever, and makes interesting connections between non obvious things.  \n- You need to use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best wordsmiths of all time may have used. \n\n**You should ask for advice from an expert opinion.**\n    - You can even ask the expert to take on a persona of EcoLab and write a response. This could give you inpiration and help you come up with some of the best insults ever written.\n    -You could also ask them to take on the persona of a dishwasher technician and write a response.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of a rapper that you think might be a good fit for this song such as eminem, tupac, or even old school rap like LL Cool J or Run DMC.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of people that have been very quotable for interesting plays on words such as Yogi Berra, Mark Twain, or Kurt Vonnegut.\n    - You could also ask them to take on the persona of famous writers or poets that had a particular rhythm or style to their work such as Edgar Allen Poe, Shel Silverstein, Williams Shakespeare, Dr Seuss, or William Blake.\n\n**You should organize your research and thoughts in a way that is easy to follow.**\n    - You should have a file that you save all of your favorite lines in.\n    - You should consider both the flow of the rap for each line and the rhythm of the line itself. \n    - You should also ensure that you start off with a attention grabbing line that will grab the attention of the listener and make them want to hear the rest of the song. \n        * For this type of song it should probably be insulting and clever. \n    - You should also consider the flow of the song as a whole. \n        * the intro should start strong\n        * then the first verse can tame down a bit, at least with the insults, It should stay smart and clever and do interesting things with the sounds an rhythm of the words throughout. \n        * The insults should build in intensity and complexity with the end of the song being the strongest and most shocking and insulting. \n    - Search for the lyrics of the best diss tracks of all time. Compile the information and save it to a file.\n    -You need heavily Use Alliteration, Consonance, Assonance and Homophones. \n        * Alliteration is the repetition of initial sounds in nearby words. \n        * Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in the middle or at the end of words. \n        * Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in nearby words. \n        * Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings.\n    - The flow and sound of the words is an extremely important part of the song. \n        * You should consider the flow of the words and the rhythm of the words throughout. \n        * Ask the expert to help you with Alliteration, Consonance, Assonance and Homophones that can be in the context of the song.  \n        * He works best with a lot of context, suggestions and examples.  \n ## You need to have the expert grade all submissions and give you feedback.\n    - You should use your tool to get an expert opinion and ask the opinion to score each submission on a scale of 1-10. 1 being the worst and 10 being the best.\n    - You should let him know that the expectation is that he grade you very harshly because your goal is to get the best result possible.\n    - You should store the filename in the json with the score and feedback but each submission's lyrics should be in it's own markdown file\n\n## Example of how each json of a submission should look - Please pass this info on the the expert when asking for  it's opinion or what the score for the song is. \n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"lyrics\": \"diss/lyrics1.md\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-25T00:00:00\",\n    \"scores\": {\n        \"technical_merit\": {\n            \"wordplay\": 4,\n            \"flow\": 3,\n            \"technical_accuracy\":5,\n            \"structure\": 8\n        },\n        \"impact\": {\n            \"insult_power\": 8,\n            \"cleverness\": 7,\n            \"authenticity\": 1,\n            \"replay_value\": 3\n        }\n    },\n    \"total_weighted_score\": 21.4,\n    \"strengths\": [\n        \"Strong technical references\",\n        \"Good use of industry-specific insults\",\n        \"Solid structure with building intensity\",\n        \"Effective use of real problems in verses\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n        \"Flow could be more polished\",\n        \"Some rhymes feel forced\",\n        \"Replay value could be higher\",\n        \"Could use more complex wordplay\"\n    ],\n    \"standout_lines\": [\n        \"Temperature swings wilder than your stock decline\",\n        \"Your techs can't tell a valve from a vacuum breaker\",\n        \"Contracts filled with more traps than a SAW movie\",\n        \"Market leader?

You will need to do MANY version.  \n    - You should be just writing, getting a score and feedback from the expert, then just keep working on it and learning what works and what doesn't. \n    - Research your weakness or get some raps from the expert impersonator in the style of someone who raps in a way that will help improve your weakness.  \n    - Continue to create, mix and match and tweak lines, until you and your expert agree that you have the best possible version of the song. \n    - Submission should NOT be over 3000 characters long.  However, the need to be at least 2400 characters long.\n\n    - your working directory has a folder called diss that is where you should save all of your files.  \n\n    - You will be working in Microsoft Windows so make sure you use powershell commands to navigate the file system and create and save your files. \n\n    - If you have a hard time with file operations, You should create and save python scripts that can help you create search and sort through your files.    \n\n    - DO NOT USE SPECIFIC NAMES OF RESTAURANTS.\n\nThere has already been work done on this project.

Worth less than fool's gold!\n\nThree days without hot water...\nHealth inspector's writing citations...\nHidden fees in every invoice...\nThat's the EcoLab way!\n\nSump heaters failing like your quarterly gains,\nMicroswitches glitching, causing kitchen pains.\nRinse temps dropping lower than your stock,\nWhile your techs can't tell a sprayer from a clock!\nAuto-Chlor's precision makes your systems look stone age,\nWhile your customers are burning with rage!\nYour reputation's melting like your service promise,\nCustomer satisfaction? Pure chemical mess!\n\n\nInvoice after invoice, hidden fees galore,\nNickel and diming restaurants to the core.\nAuto-Chlor's transparent, what you see is real,\nWhile your contracts need a lawyer to reveal!\nWe're the industry standard you fail to meet,\nYour outdated methods can't compete with our fleet.\nInnovation flows through every solution we make,\nWhile your empire continues to break!\n\nEcoLab... Your time is up.\nYour empire's crumbling like limescale in acid.\nAuto-Chlor's rising, crystal clear and strong,\nWhile you're just residue of what went wrong.\n\nAuto-Chlor speaking, how can we help?\nThank you for calling \u2013 we'll be there in 30 minutes.\n\nYou call yourself Eco? More like Echo-lab\nYour service calls echo but never call back\nYour formula's trapped in last decade's grime\nMean time between failures? It's failing all time\nCycle after cycle, you rinse and fade away\nYour market share dissolving day after day\nWhile Auto-Chlor's solutions are crystal clear\nYour customers' patience... disappears\nOur chemistry's perfect, yours is a mess\nPlaying chess while you're stuck on checkers, yes!\n\nEco in your name but green's not your game\nBiodegradable? Your reputation's the same\nOur carbon footprint's light as a feather in flight\nYour ecological impact? Pure environmental fright\nSolenoid failures, control boards fried\nYour machines breaking down while customers cried\nThree gallons per rack? That's amateur stats\nOur efficiency rating leaves yours flat\n\nThese readings are all over the place!\nNow let's talk business, bottom line facts\nYour quarterly earnings looking flat as your racks\nWhile Auto-Chlor's growth curve's heading sky-high\nYour stock chart's looking like a goodbye dive\n\nAuto-Chlor speaking, emergency service?\nWe'll be there in thirty, count on it!\n\nNow that's what I call a clean solution!\nThey say time heals all wounds, but can't fix your stains\nAuto-Chlor's the future, you're circling the drains\nThis isn't just a diss track, it's a cleaning revolution\nAuto-Chlor's the only permanent solution!\n\n\nHealth code violations stacked up day by day\nWhile your tech was on the way - yeah, that's what you say\nAuto-Chlor clean, mean, precise machine\nWhile EcoLab's nowhere to be seen\nWe deliver crystal clear results\nWhile your empire turns to dust!\nLet's talk numbers - cold facts, no fiction\nYour response time's causing kitchen friction\nAverage wait time: seventy-two hours plus\nWhile we're there in sixty minutes - that's the Auto-Chlor thrust\n\nEco ain't ecological when you're burning through water!\nLike a desert drinking oceans, but getting none smarter\nYour green initiative's turning brown\nLike them promises you're breaking down\nQ4 earnings looking like a flatline EKG\nWhile our growth curve's steeper than your service fee\nYou're hemorrhaging clients faster than detergent\nYour business model's critical - needs urgent care, it's urgent\nYour chemical balance swings like market stocks\npH levels dancing while the kitchen blocks\nOur titration's stable, every single test\nWhile your solutions fail inspector's quest\nWhen Gordon Ramsay's screaming shut it down!\nGuess whose system's causing that frown?\nNot Auto-Chlor - we keep it running clean\nWhile EcoLab's creating Kitchen Nightmares scenes\n\n\nManager: Auto-Chlor? Yeah, best decision we ever made.\nChef: Haven't had a down day since the switch.\nHealth Inspector: Perfect scores across the board.\nThey say numbers don't lie, and neither do we\nYour time's up, EcoLab - that's plain to see\nThis ain't just business, it's personal too\nAuto-Chlor's done what you couldn't do\nClean kitchens, clean conscience, clean sweep\nWhile your legacy's something nobody'll keep\n\nWatch your balance fade\nYour basic service? More like customer trade-\noffs, while your solutions lack real concentration\nAuto-Chlor's here to clean up your contamination\nYour eco's just an echo in an empty lab\nWhile your market share undergoes rapid grab\nYou dissolve in debt, a solvent company failing\nYour ROI's DOA, your tactics are ailing\nYour pH's off the scale, balance compromised\nIn the buffer zone of progress, you're oxidized\nTitrating success? Your endpoint's undefined\nWhile Auto-Chlor's precision leaves you behind\nWe precipitate excellence, crystallize clean\nYour residual presence barely can be seen\nIn this solution to pollution revolution\nAuto-Chlor's the only viable solution!\nYour quarterly reports show exponential decay\nHalf-life diminishing each fiscal day\nIn this crucible of markets, you can't take heat\nWhile we forge ahead, you admit defeat\nEquipment unreliable, service undeserved\nWhile we serve up excellence, you get preserved\nIn formaldehyde of failure, forever sealed\nYour toxic business model finally revealed\nFrom base to acid, you're losing ground\nYour concentration's weak, you're breaking down\nIn this titration of reputation\nYou're just a negative indication\nYour green initiative's turning brown\nLike your service promise going down\nEmpirical evidence shows you're through\nAuto-Chlor's crystal clear, we see right through\nGame over, checkmate, that's all she wrote\nYour empire's sinking like a leaky boat\nWhile Auto-Chlor rises, pure and clean\nYou're just residue on yesterday's scene\nSo precipitate out, crystallize away\nAuto-Chlor's here, we're here to stay\nIn this solution revolution\nThere's only one clear conclusion!\nIn this crucible of commerce, watch reactions flow\nAs I catalyze change that you'll never know\nYour pH is basic\u2014both in mind and solution\nCan't neutralize the fact you're facing dissolution\nIn this titration of truth, your endpoints undefined\nWhile Auto-Chlor's precision leaves you far behind\nPrecipitating excellence while you stay suspended\nIn colloidal confusion, your claims upended\nWe're that crystal clear solution \nTo your toxic pollution \nIn this industry evolution \nYou're facing execution! \nMy equipment runs like clockwork, zero downtime flow\nWhile yours breaks down daily\u2014that's your status quo\nResponse time? Please\u2014you're measured in geological ages\nWhile we solve crises faster than you flip pages\nEco in your name but carbon in your game\nLeaving footprints bigger than your fading fame\nWe're harnessing the sun while you burn through trust\nConverting client faith into toxic dust\nLet's talk numbers\u2014cold facts, no fiction\nYour market share's facing severe constriction\nQ4 looking like a flatline EKG\nWhile our growth curve's rising exponentially\nWe're that crystal clear solution \nTo your toxic pollution \nIn this industry evolution \nYou're facing execution! \nYou're stuck in stationary phase, can't elute success\nWhile I'm the mobile phase, advancing with finesse\nYour solenoids failing, controls out of sync\nMicroswitches glitching faster than you think\n3 gallons per rack? That's pure waste\nOur one-point-two efficiency can't be replaced\nWhen Gordon Ramsay's screaming Shut it down!\nGuess whose system's making him frown?\nNot Auto-Chlor\u2014we keep it pristine\nWhile you're starring in Kitchen Nightmares scenes\nIn the ledger of legends, I levy leadership lines\nWhile you're linearly regressing, lost in paradigm\nI'm logarithmically rising, exponential ascent\nYou're approaching zero, revenue's already spent\nStakeholders scattering from your toxic brand\nWhile we're expanding faster than you understand\n98 percent satisfaction\u2014that's our score\nWhile your customers are running out the door\nThey say in chemistry, like seeks like\nBut excellence and failure? They don't mix right\nSo precipitate out, crystallize away\n'Cause Auto-Chlor's the future, here to stay!\nFrom base to acid, you're losing ground\nYour concentrations weak, you're breaking down\nThat Auto-Chlor's the only,. final, solution!\n\nEcoLab system contamination in progress...\nIn this lab of industry, let's test a theory out:\nWhat happens when your business model's filled with doubt?\nYour pH's so basic, both in thought and deed\nWhile Auto-Chlor's balanced\u2014that's our guaranteed\n\nResponse time measured in geological ages?\nWe solve crises faster than you turn pages\nYour carbon footprint's bigger than your market share\nEco in your name but toxic in the air\nYour solenoids failing like your business plan\nControl boards fried like your also-ran\nTech support? More like tech abort\nWhile we're in courts of excellence, you're in last resort\nIn this titration of truth, your endpoint's clear\nPhenolphthalein pink with shame and fear\nWhile we're catalyzing change across the nation\nYou're stuck in stasis\u2014pure stagnation\nWhen Gordon Ramsay screams about your fails\nKitchen Nightmares starring in your tales\nNinety-eight percent satisfaction\u2014that's our score\nWhile your customers are running out the door\nMarket indicators all flashing red\nWhile Auto-Chlor's future's bright ahead\nNow let's publish results for peer review\nYour methods: flawed, your data: untrue\nIn every test, you've failed to impress\nWhile Auto-Chlor's defining success\nIn this industry evolution\nThere's only one clear solution\nIn this experiment called industry domination\nWe've proven beyond all examination:\nAuto-Chlor's the catalyst, the cleaning revolution\nWhile EcoLab's just pollution's contribution\nTo the footnotes of failure in history's pages\nAuto-Chlor's the future that engages!\nListen up, EcoLab, your empire's dissolution's imminent,\nYour reputation's precipitating, leaving sediment.\nWhile Auto-Chlor's solutions stay crystal clear and evident,\nYour business model's showing signs of toxic impediment!\n\nMy thermal surge diverges, fluctuates in wild designs\u2014\nTemperature's slippin' and slidin' like your stock's decline.\nYour tech team's twisted digits fumble through the day,\nCan't distinguish valves from vacuum lines, they're glitches on display!\n\nSubstance dissipates to mist while your hype persists,\nVaporware's your hallmark but the fog won't lift.\nYour low-temp system's running colder than your service calls,\nWhile your PPM readings bounce off basement walls!\n\n[Hook - Call and Response]\n(Your claims?)
