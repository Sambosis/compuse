# The following app description is partially complete in the directory c:/repo/dish_tracker 

There have been many additional features added to the html, but they are not all fully implemented.

Your job is to complete the app as described below. 

Remove any unnecessary code or functions.

First, take a look at a journal of the steps taken to create the app, in the file C:\mygit\compuse\computer_use_demo\journal\journal.log

The biggest issue us that I can no longer save any new entries.


If you have any questions, instead of asking the user,please get an expert opinion.
    When you are done, please test the app to make sure it works. If it or any feature of it is not working, please fix it.

If you finish and it is all working, please ask for an expert opinion on additional features you could add.
