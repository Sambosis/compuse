    -You could also ask them to take on the persona of a dishwasher technician and write a response.
    - You could ask them to take on the persona of a rapper that you think might be a good fit for this song such as eminem, tupac, or even old school rap like LL Cool J or Run DMC.
    - You could ask them to take on the persona of people that have been very quotable for interesting plays on words such as Yogi Berra, Mark Twain, or Kurt Vonnegut.
    - You could also ask them to take on the persona of famous writers or poets that had a particular rhythm or style to their work such as Edgar Allen Poe, Shel Silverstein, Williams Shakespeare, Dr Seuss, or William Blake.

    - You should also consider the flow of the song as a whole. While the intro should start strong, then the first verse can tame down a bit, at least with the insults, It should stay smart and clever and do interesting things with the sounds an rhythm of the words throughout.

## Additional Information
    - You need to figure out how to write the best. It is up to you to learn. I can't do it for you.  No body becomes the best after just writing a few times. You will need to do MANY version.  You should be just writing, getting a score and feedback from the expert, then just keep working on it and learning what works and what doesn't. 
    - Research your weakness or get some raps from the expert impersonator in the style of someone who raps in a way that will help improve your weakness.  
    - Continue to create, mix and match and tweak lines, until you and your expert agree that you have the best possible version of the song. 

    - your working directory has a folder called diss that is where you should save all of your files.  

    - You will be working in Microsoft Windows so make sure you use powershell commands to navigate the file system and create and save your files. 

    - If you have a hard time with file operations, You should create and save python scripts that can help you create search and sort through your files.    
    - You already have some work done for you.  go through the files in the diss folder and to read the raps you have already written.  And look at the python helper file that has been written.

Intro]
Yo, Auto-Chlor on the mic, time to bring the heat,  
EcoLab's crumbling, can't handle this beat.  
We're the kings of clean, you're the jester of grime,  
Your service is a joke, your machines past their prime.

[Verse 1]
Listen up, EcoLab, you chemical clown,  
Your service is shotty, you're losing your crown.  
Your quality's dropped, but not your marketing slime,  
Your service is a joke, your machines past their prime.  

You're slower than molasses when the dishes pile high,  
Restaurants drowning while you tell them a lie.  
Health inspectors rolling deep, citations in hand,  
'Cause your dispensers fail harder than your business plan.

[Chorus]
Titration nation, watch that PPM rise!  
(EcoLab!) Your empire's oxidized!  
While you're out here pushing watered-down lies,  
We're that pure concentrate that sanitizzzze!

[Verse 2]
You strut around claiming you're top of the trade,  
But your chems are so weak, Wagner'd be an upgrade!  
Your service department's a technical wreck,  
Three days of downtime for a five-minute check.

Your billing schemes flow like a leaky pipe,  
Hidden charges creeping, restaurants feel the hype.  
You're the virus, we're the vaccination,  
Cleaning up the fallout from your contamination.

[Bridge: Double Meanings in the Wash]
Your Eco is ironic, your footprint's a crime,  
Burning through resources like they're overtime.  
Your contracts? A maze of fine-printed inflation,  
Bleeding restaurants dry with each installation.

Your solutions leave kitchens in disarray,  
While customers flee faster day after day.  
Auto-Chlor's precision makes your systems look broke,  
Just another has-been going up in smoke.

[Verse 3]
EcoLab, you're a landfill of lies,  
Overflowing with broken promises and tries.  
Your chemicals weaker than your customer care,  
You're ghosting so hard, you disappear in thin air.

Your dispensers drip like your credibility,  
Promises hollow, soaked in futility.  
You're the grease trap cloggin' up the lane,  
Auto-Chlor's the scrubber that's removing the stain.

[Chorus]
Titration nation, watch that PPM rise!  
(EcoLab!) Your empire's oxidized!  
While you're out here pushing watered-down lies,  
We're that pure concentrate that sanitizzzze!

[Verse 4]
Your reputation's dirtier than a clogged-up drain,  
Your machines break down and drive customers insane.  
You're the stain that won't lift, the grime that persists,  
But Auto-Chlor's here with industrial grit.

We're the power wash to your cracked façade,  
Your empire's imploding—oh, my God!  
So pack up your lies, your weak-ass machines,  
Auto-Chlor's the future; every customer’s wet dream.

[Outro]
EcoLab, consider this your resignation,  
You've been overrun by your own contamination.
Mic dropped, mess mopped, Auto-Chlor reigns,  
EcoLab's just the stain that remains in the drain.

Auto-Chlor's crystal clear, the best in the biz,  
While you vanish like the suds—poof! Gone with a fizz.

------
Here are some additional lines I'm considering adding or using to replace current lines.

Listen up, EcoLab, you beaker buffoon,  
Your service precipitates, dissolves too soon.  

Quality's evaporated, but your hype stays undiluted,  
Your tech's rusting out, plans poorly executed.

Your marketing's slick, but it's covered in slime,
Sliding past the truth every single time.

(EcoLab!) Your empire’s corroding, bound to end!
(EcoLab!) Polluting the supply!

Chemical charade, cloaked in counterfeit claims,  
Sluggish solutions, sinking in shame.

We're the clear solution, transparency's our game,
You dissolve like bubbles, nothing of you remains.

Your soft claims harden when tested in our waters,
We leave no residue while your service falters.

Our pH is balanced, neutral and pure,
Your acidic nature customers can't endure.

Choosing you is a biohazard, they buy a hazard instead,
We’re the safe choice, keeping businesses ahead.

We're the catalyst sparking industry change, 
You're the inert gas, unreactive and strange.

EcoLab's lagging, lacking, slacking, 
Auto-Chlor's attacking, cracking, unpacking.


Your dispensers cough and sputter, barely getting through,  
Auto-Chlor’s systems sing, efficient and true.
