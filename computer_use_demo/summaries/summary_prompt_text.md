  6. Create documentation structure
  7. Implement test_operations.py

- Next Steps:
  1. Confirm working directory location
  2. Execute uv venv create command
  3. Install project in editable mode
  4. Verify virtual environment activation
  5. Begin test implementation

```text
Environment preparation continues to progress.
Next immediate action: Verify working directory and execute uv initialization commands.
All preliminary checks remain valid.
Ready to proceed with virtual environment creation using uv.
