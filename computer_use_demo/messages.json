You are writing a rap battle style diss song about a company called EcoLab.  They make dishwasher detergent, lease dishwashers, and service them as well as provide all of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals for restaurants.  They are the bad guy and you are the good guy.  You are Auto-Chlor.  You are going to destroy EcoLab and take over their market share. They have been falling apart for the past few years and Auto-Chlor has been steadily growing. We are going to destroy them and take over their market share.\n\n- You need to come up with a rap battle style diss song that is 100% insulting, clever, and makes interesting connections between non obvious things.  \n- You need to use intricate word play involving double meanings or even more complicated tricks that the best wordsmiths of all time may have used. \n\n**You should ask for advice from an expert opinion.**\n    - You can even ask the expert to take on a persona of EcoLab and write a response. This could give you inpiration and help you come up with some of the best insults ever written.\n    -You could also ask them to take on the persona of a dishwasher technician and write a response.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of a rapper that you think might be a good fit for this song such as eminem, tupac, or even old school rap like LL Cool J or Run DMC.\n    - You could ask them to take on the persona of people that have been very quotable for interesting plays on words such as Yogi Berra, Mark Twain, or Kurt Vonnegut.\n    - You could also ask them to take on the persona of famous writers or poets that had a particular rhythm or style to their work such as Edgar Allen Poe, Shel Silverstein, Williams Shakespeare, Dr Seuss, or William Blake.\n\n**You should organize your research and thoughts in a way that is easy to follow.**\n    - You should have a file that you save all of your favorite lines in.\n    - You should consider both the flow of the rap for each line and the rhythm of the line itself. \n    - You should also ensure that you start off with a attention grabbing line that will grab the attention of the listener and make them want to hear the rest of the song. \n        * For this type of song it should probably be insulting and clever. \n    - You should also consider the flow of the song as a whole. \n        * the intro should start strong\n        * then the first verse can tame down a bit, at least with the insults, It should stay smart and clever and do interesting things with the sounds an rhythm of the words throughout. \n        * The insults should build in intensity and complexity with the end of the song being the strongest and most shocking and insulting. \n    - Search for the lyrics of the best diss tracks of all time. Compile the information and save it to a file.\n    -You need heavily Use Alliteration, Consonance, Assonance and Homophones. \n        * Alliteration is the repetition of initial sounds in nearby words. \n        * Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in the middle or at the end of words. \n        * Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in nearby words. \n        * Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings.\n    - The flow and sound of the words is an extremely important part of the song. \n        * You should consider the flow of the words and the rhythm of the words throughout. \n        * Ask the expert to help you with Alliteration, Consonance, Assonance and Homophones that can be in the context of the song.  \n        * He works best with a lot of context, suggestions and examples.  \n ## You need to have the expert grade all submissions and give you feedback.\n    - You should use your tool to get an expert opinion and ask the opinion to score each submission on a scale of 1-10. 1 being the worst and 10 being the best.\n    - You should let him know that the expectation is that he grade you very harshly because your goal is to get the best result possible.\n    - You should store the filename in the json with the score and feedback but each submission's lyrics should be in it's own markdown file\n\n## Example of how each json of a submission should look - Please pass this info on the the expert when asking for  it's opinion or what the score for the song is. \n{\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"lyrics\": \"diss/lyrics1.md\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-25T00:00:00\",\n    \"scores\": {\n        \"technical_merit\": {\n            \"wordplay\": 4,\n            \"flow\": 3,\n            \"technical_accuracy\":5,\n            \"structure\": 8\n        },\n        \"impact\": {\n            \"insult_power\": 8,\n            \"cleverness\": 7,\n            \"authenticity\": 1,\n            \"replay_value\": 3\n        }\n    },\n    \"total_weighted_score\": 21.4,\n    \"strengths\": [\n        \"Strong technical references\",\n        \"Good use of industry-specific insults\",\n        \"Solid structure with building intensity\",\n        \"Effective use of real problems in verses\"\n    ],\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n        \"Flow could be more polished\",\n        \"Some rhymes feel forced\",\n        \"Replay value could be higher\",\n        \"Could use more complex wordplay\"\n    ],\n    \"standout_lines\": [\n        \"Temperature swings wilder than your stock decline\",\n        \"Your techs can't tell a valve from a vacuum breaker\",\n        \"Contracts filled with more traps than a SAW movie\",\n        \"Market leader?
