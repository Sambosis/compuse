2. Remove or handle `lease_terms` attribute
3. Implement proper error logging
4. Add validation to prevent similar errors

## Suggested Code Fix:
```python
def get_sales(self):
    try:
        # Remove or conditionally handle lease_terms
        sale_data = {
            key: value for key, value in sale.__dict__.items() 
            if hasattr(sale, key)
        }
        return sale_data
    except Exception as e:
        # Improved error handling
        logging.error(f"Sales data retrieval error: {e}")
        raise
```

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot see screenshots or images. Could you please describe what you're trying to do or provide more context about the screenshot? I'll do my best to help you based on the information you share.

User: (User did not send any details about the screenshot or task)

<session_analysis>
1. Key Actions: None identified
2. Files Edited: None identified
3. Critical Issues: Unable to process a screenshot without context
4. Outcomes: No specific outcomes due to lack of information

Entry #2 - 2024-11-22 01:07:26
A random mouse move input was received, with the mouse being positioned at coordinates (426, 1049). However, no specific context or intention was provided about why the mouse was moved to these coordinates.

Since there isn't a clear coding session or technical task to summarize, I cannot generate a structured journal entry. A journal entry requires specific actions, files modified, tasks completed, and outcomes. Would you like to provide more context about what coding or technical work was being done?

# Task: Mouse Coordinate Interaction

## Actions Taken:
1. User shared specific mouse coordinates
2. Assistant responded with a lighthearted comment about searching for mouse videos

Entry #9 - 2024-11-22 01:09:10
I apologize, but this interaction seems incomplete or lacking context. The conversation appears to start abruptly with a key press and then jumps to a response about YouTube playlists and mice videos, which doesn't seem connected. 

To create a meaningful journal entry, I would need more details about:
- The specific coding task or context
- Actions taken during the session
- Files or code modified
- Challenges encountered
- Outcomes achieved

Could you provide more information about the coding interaction you'd like me to summarize?
