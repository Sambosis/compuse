[CONVERSATION SUMMARY]

Great. Now I'll write the new version incorporating the expert feedback and enhanced technical elements. Let me write the content for lyrics3.md:

[Intro]
Diluted claims evaporate when immersed in our flow
EcoLab's about to learn what industry pros know
Your chemical charade's about to decompose
While Auto-Chlor's concentration keeps reaching new highs, you're hitting new lows

[Verse 1]
You're diluted, like your solutions\u2014can't handle the concentration we're producin'
Your tech's so basic, while we're advanced interactions
Got your whole operation breaking down into fractions
Chemical reactions leave you in contractions

Your service precipitates, dissolves too soon
Leaving restaurants stranded like a chemical monsoon
We sanitize the scene while you contaminate dreams
Auto-Chlor's supreme, bursting at the seams

[Chorus]
Flow so corrosive, got you eroding (What?)
Auto-Chlor explodes while EcoLab's imploding (Yeah!)
We're the catalyst igniting sparks you can't contain
You're just the residue that's circling the drain

[Verse 2]
In this equation, you're the leftover waste
Your quality control's an absolute disgrace
We're the solution in this saturated space
While you're the byproduct nobody wants to face

Temperature swings wilder than your stock decline
Your techs can't tell a valve from a vacuum line
Choosing you's a biohazard\u2014they're paying to get poisoned faster
While we're the masters, turning service into rapture

[Bridge]
Your pH is unstable as your market position
We're titrating truth while you're stuck in transition
Your soft claims harden when tested in our waters
Leading to your molecular slaughter

[Verse 3]
EcoLab's lagging, lacking, slacking
While we're attacking, cracking codes, unpacking facts and stacking
Your dispensers cough and sputter, barely getting through
Auto-Chlor systems sing\u2014efficient and true

We're that pure concentrate that sanitize
Watch your empire oxidize
In this industry equation, victory's derived
Auto-Chlor rises while EcoLab dies

[Outro]
In this equation, you're the residue
Auto-Chlor's the main event, nothing left of you
We're the catalyst that changed the game
While you dissolve into chemical shame
